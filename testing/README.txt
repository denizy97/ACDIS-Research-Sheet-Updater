This is for testing whether the keyword searching algorithm is able to find every file research in every csv file or not.

If a research isn't found there can be 3 reasons for that:
1- Research or researcher doesn't exist in the Experts API
2- Research has no abstract so a keyword search isn't possible
3- None of the keywords are present in the research.

If you want to print the results just type in the console:
python keyword_test.py > test_results.text

Followed by:
the API key.
It is in the file named "the key" or you can contact experts-help@illinois.edu to get a new one. More info on publish.illinois.edu/researchconnections/?page_id=67
